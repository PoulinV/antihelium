//	This is a set of files for the calculation of the antiproton flux at the Earth.
//	The background of secondary antiprotons originates from the spallation reactions
//	of cosmic ray (CR) protons and helium nuclei on the interstellar medium (ISM).
//	Primary antiprotons are produced directly by the annihilation or decay of dark
//	matter (DM) species in the halo of the Milky Way.

//	Authors Mathieu Boudaud and Pierre Salati
