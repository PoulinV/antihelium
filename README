//	This is a code for the calculation of the antiproton and antinuclei flux at the 
//	Earth originating from the spallation reactions of cosmic ray (CR) protons and 	
//	helium nuclei on the  interstellar medium (ISM).
//	Primary antiprotons are produced directly by the annihilation or decay of dark
//	matter (DM) species in the halo of the Milky Way.

//	Authors Mathieu Boudaud and Pierre Salati for the antiproton
		Vivian Poulin and Pierre Salati for the antinuclei


----- COMPILING -----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make (-j)


---- RUNNING -----
Running the code currently requires modification of 2 files that you can find in the main directory.
- COMMON.h: One mostly needs to specify which anti-nuclei is computed. Propagation parameters can also be adjusted there. 
- MAIN.c: if you want a primary component from DM (only for p-bar), a few lines must be uncommented. To be improved.

then compile and run ./executable


---- RESULTS -----

Remember to create a folder ``results'' within which output files will be produced. These contain the results of the calculation. The path to the files is written in COMMON.h.
